# Event Chain Debugger

A debugging tool that makes event-driven JavaScript code easy to follow. It records every event in a time window, shows how events connect, and replays the timeline visually so you can watch pathways light up as events fire.

## Distribution

- Published on npm.
- JavaScript frameworks only for the first version.

## What an "event" is

An event is **who called it and what it called, including payloads**.

- Caller: the emitter (and the handler that was running when it emitted, if any)
- Callee: the handler(s) the event reached
- Payload: the data passed along

## Mental model

- An **event chain** is a linked list: each event points to the event that caused it.
- **Handlers are the nodes** of that list.
- All chains together form a **web of connected nodes**. One handler can appear in many chains.

## Core features

1. **Recording**: log every event within a configurable time window.
2. **Tree / web view**: show handlers as nodes and event routes as pathways between them.
3. **Replay**: play the recorded timeline back visually. Pathways light up when their event fires. Play, pause, and scrub.
4. **Inspection**: the user can highlight and inspect nodes and pathways.
5. **Configurable replay window**: the user chooses which slice of time to replay.
6. **Zoom levels**:
   - Zoom out: processes
   - Zoom into a process: see all of its handlers
   - Zoom into a handler: see what it has been doing (its event history, payloads, timings, errors)

## Storage: templates instead of full copies

Events are grouped into **reference groups (templates)**. Each recorded event is stored as a reference to its template plus the minimum per-occurrence data (timestamp, parent link, ids), instead of storing all of its own data.

- Default: template reference only.
- Opt-in: the user can choose to store full unique data (e.g. full payloads) for specific events.
- Replay uses the template to render each occurrence.

**Open question:** how events get grouped into a template. Candidates to evaluate:
- emitter + event name + handler set
- the above plus payload shape (keys/types, not values)

Grouping must be stable enough that replay stays accurate, and it must be clear in the UI when an occurrence's data is template-only vs fully captured.

## Technical notes from planning

These are suggestions from the planning discussion, not final decisions.

- **Replay does not re-run user code.** It plays back recorded data against the graph, so it is safe and deterministic.
- **Causality (parent links):** track the "currently handling" event inside a wrapped `emit`.
  - Synchronous emits: a simple stack works.
  - Async emits (after `await`, timers): use `AsyncLocalStorage` in Node. Browsers have no built-in equivalent yet (TC39 AsyncContext was still a Stage 2 draft as of mid-2026), so mark async-hop links as "inferred" in the UI. Keep the context layer swappable so AsyncContext can replace it later.
- **Memory:** ring buffer bounded by time or count. Templates help here too.
- **Package shape:**
  - `core`: recorder, buffer, templates, causality, JSON export. No DOM dependency.
  - `ui`: the visual replay viewer (in-page overlay first; DevTools extension later).
  - Adapters: Node `EventEmitter`, DOM `EventTarget`, then buses like mitt / eventemitter3, then framework events (Vue `emit`, React).
- **Setup should be near zero:** hook the dispatcher so one line enables recording, rather than instrumenting each emit call.

## First milestone

- Core recorder with templates
- `EventEmitter` and `EventTarget` adapters
- Synchronous causality only
- Replay viewer: play/pause/scrub, lit-up pathways, click-to-inspect, replay window control, process → handler → activity zoom
- A demo app with a simulated event stream to exercise the viewer
